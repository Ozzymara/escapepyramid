## 🎨 Colours

The colour palette was carefully selected to enhance the user experience, ensuring both visual appeal and accessibility. Since Pyramid Escape is an interactive, immersive experience, the colours play a crucial role in setting the mood, aiding readability, and creating a harmonious yet engaging aesthetic.

Through extensive research, colour theory principles were applied to achieve a balance between atmosphere, engagement, and usability. The colours were tested using accessibility tools such as the Colour Contrast Checker (also available as a Chrome extension), WebAIM Contrast Checker, and Adobe Color Contrast Analyzer to ensure WCAG compliance and optimal readability.

To guarantee adherence to accessibility standards, the [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/) (also available as a Chrome extension), [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) Contrast Checker, and [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) tools were used to validate contrast levels. These tools helped to make informed decisions regarding the final design.

| Section      | Background        | Hex      | RGB             | Foreground       | Hex      | RGB             | Ratio | AAA Result |
|-------------|------------------|----------|-----------------|------------------|----------|-----------------|---|--| 
| **Title**    | Saddle Brown      | #5d4926  | (93, 73, 38)    | Peach             | #fee7a5  | (254, 231, 165) |7.03| <span style="color:#39FF14">Pass</span>|
| **Story Box**| Licorice Black    | #1f1514  | (31, 21, 20)    | Mint Cream        | #eafbf8  | (234, 251, 248) |16.72|<span style="color:#39FF14">Pass</span>|
| **Buttons**  | Camel             | #c2a86e  | (194, 168, 110) | Jet Black         | #111111  | (17, 17, 17)    |8.2|<span style="color:#39FF14">Pass</span>|

Each colour combination was validated for accessibility, ensuring appropriate contrast levels for readability.

<summary>Click to view Papyrus font  </summary>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ozzymara/docpe/refs/heads/main/assets/documentation/font.webp" alt="Papyrus font" style="width:50%;"></details>
<br>

Typography plays a crucial role in setting the tone and atmosphere of the game, ensuring an immersive experience for players.

Headings & Body Text – Papyrus (Fantasy)
Both the headings and body text use Papyrus, reinforcing the ancient Egyptian theme. 

Papyrus is a proprietary typeface designed by Chris Costello in 1982 and is commonly pre-installed on some operating systems, but it is not offered as a free web font through Google Fonts. If you want to use Papyrus on the web, you would need to ensure users have it installed on their system or obtain a proper license for web embedding.

The hand-carved, textured letterforms evoke the feeling of weathered hieroglyphics etched into stone, immersing players in the mystery of the pyramid's forgotten secrets.

To enhance readability, the body text is styled with a parchment-like tone, making it easier to absorb while staying true to the game's aesthetics. Subtle shadow effects and spacing adjustments ensure clarity across different screen sizes.

Typography Harmony
Using Papyrus throughout creates a unified thematic experience, maintaining the sense of lost knowledge and ancient magic. Paired with sand-colored accents and glowing effects, this choice strengthens the immersive storytelling and adventure-driven gameplay.

## 📱 Wireframes

Wireframes play a crucial role in shaping a website’s architecture, ensuring a cohesive and well-optimised experience for users. The wireframes for this project have been created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to define the core feature layout, ensuring a user-friendly experience that prioritises clarity and ease of navigation. These low-fidelity wireframes serve as a foundational guide for structuring the site's design and responsiveness across different screen sizes.

# 🧪 Testing and Validation

**Overview**  
Throughout the course of the project, testing and validation were conducted to ensure functionality, responsiveness, and usability. Importantly, testing in Incognito Mode is crucial because it provides a clean testing environment without cached data, stored cookies, or browser extensions interfering with the site’s URL. Essentially, it mimics a first-time visitor's experience, making sure the site works as expected for new users without any hidden browser influences.

**Testing Methods**  
• *Debugging and Browser Tools*: Regular debugging and testing were performed using [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools) to analyse and troubleshoot issues efficiently.  
<!-- • Testing Sheet: A structured approach was followed using the MHA testing sheet (Google read-only) to verify compliance and accessibility.   -->
• *Peer Code Review*: The team provided a "fresh set of eyes" through peer code reviews, helping identify potential issues that were overlooked.

</details><br>

When MS Copilot generated code, occasional stray elements like <span style="font-family:monospace;">&lt;/span&gt;</span> and other closing tags appeared due to the way it predicted and completed code snippets. These errors were flagged during HTML validation and were corrected in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Additionally, the use of explicit ARIA role attributes (e.g. role="button", role="main") on HTML elements was initially guided by recommendations from the WAVE accessibility tool. However, these roles are inherently implied by the semantic HTML5 elements themselves. The Nu HTML Validator correctly flags them as unnecessary. To ensure leaner, more semantic code and to align with modern best practices, we chose to deselect checking redundant role attributes. Resultantly, the current version of the game shows <span style="color:#39FF14">no errors</span>.

This document validates as CSS level 3 + SVG.

## [✅ JS Validation](https://jshint.com/)

*Process*: JavaScript files were validated using several validators.

The longer the work on a project, the larger the codebase becomes, so by validating JavaScript code regularly, the benefits include:  
•	Catch fundamental errors  
•	Prevents potentially disastrous bugs  
•	Have cleaner, safer, and maintainable code  
•	Speed up the code-writing process  
•	Save many hours of debugging  

To ensure code clarity, consistency, and maintainability across all modern environments, I ran the project through four independent linters:

1.	Piliapp JavaScript Validator

<details>
<summary>Click to view Piliapp validation results</summary>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ozzymara/docpe/refs/heads/main/assets/documentation/PiliApp.webp" alt="PiliApp results" style="width:50%;"></details><br>

Piliapp was used as a quick JavaScript validator for a fast, browser-based scan to catch obvious syntax issues. This linter offers visual error highlights and cross-checking for compatibility or missed typos across versions.

2. JS Lint
<details>
<summary>Click to view JS Lint validation results</summary>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ozzymara/docpe/refs/heads/main/assets/documentation/jslint.webp" alt="JS validation results" style="width:50%;"></details><br>

JSLint was then used to enforce strict style and enforce structure. It enforces Douglas Crockford’s original best practices and guards against unsafe language features. Furthermore, JS Lint  catches deep structural or stylistic flaws early.

During the initial linting phase via JS Lint, the project generated 49 warnings from JSLint, primarily related to formatting, line length, and environment assumptions. To streamline development without compromising code quality:  
•	Line length and whitespace rules were relaxed to allow more flexibility in layout and readability. This brought the warning count down to 14.  
•	Activating the “Assume a browser” environment option resolved the remaining warnings by informing JSLint that browser-specific globals (like window, document, etc.) are intentional and valid in this context.  

With these configurations, the project now passes linting with zero warnings, ensuring both clarity and compatibility while remaining tuned for a web-based experience.

3. JS Hint
<details>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ozzymara/docpe/refs/heads/main/assets/documentation/jshint.webp" alt="JS validation results" style="width:80%;"></details><br>

JS Hint – Having addressed the strictness test via JS Lint, JS Hint provides a more relaxed response to JavaScript issues. Because this project uses a modern script, JS Hint was configured to allow 'New JavaScript features (ES6)'. <span style="color:#39FF14">No errors</span> are found in the current version of the game.

4. WAVE

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ozzymara/docpe/refs/heads/main/assets/documentation/wave.webp" alt="Wave results" style="width:80%;"></details><br>

WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool) Accessibility was used to audit for the HTML and UI, which scans the rendered page for issues like missing alt text, poor contrast, and improper heading structure. The focus is on the way the output serves users with disabilities. 
<span style="color:#39FF14">No errors</span> are detected in the current version. 

5.	Esprima

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ozzymara/docpe/refs/heads/main/assets/documentation/Esprima.webp" alt="Esprima results" style="width:40%;"></details><br>

Esprima Validator was used as an additional check for broader JS compatibility. This linter offers visual error highlights and cross-checking for compatibility or missed typos across versions. <span style="color:#39FF14">No errors</span> were found in the current version of the game.

## [✅ Chrome DevTools Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
• A Lighthouse audit was conducted using the tool on Chrome DevTools for each web page.  
• Categories *Performance*, *Accessibility*, *Best Practices*, and *SEO* all have a score of <span style="color:#39FF14">100</span> were found in the current version of the game.

## ✅ Semantic HTML
This project uses semantic HTML elements throughout to enhance accessibility and ensure a logical structure for all users, including those using assistive technologies.

**How Semantic HTML is Applied in This Project:**  

1.	**Key elements**  
o	✅ `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html lang="en">`, and `<meta>` tags are well-formed  
o	✅ `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` are used appropriately  
o	✅ Clear alt text for the main image  
o	✅ Consistent `type="button"` on all interactive buttons  
o	✅ Mute toggle is intuitive and accessible with aria-label and icon  

2.	**Solid Accessibility Setup**  
o	Screen readers can interpret page structure clearly  
o	Button functionality is clear and visually expressed  
o	Uses visually appropriate layout and contrast supported by CSS  

3.	**Maintainability and UX Considerations**  
o	Use of localStorage for persistent settings and music toggle  
o	Scrolling logic based on interaction  
o	`<script>` organisation is clean and componentised

- **Key Elements:**  
  - `<nav>` is used for the navigation bar, helping screen readers identify the main site navigation.
  - `<header>` contains the hero section and site introduction.
  - `<section>` is used to group related content, such as information cards, resources, and quotes.
  - `<footer>` provides consistent site information and links at the bottom of the page.
